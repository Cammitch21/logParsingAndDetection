# Apache Log Parser with Suspicious IP Detection and GeoIP Enrichment

This Python project parses Apache access logs, identifies potentially suspicious IP addresses based on 404 error activity, and enriches them with GeoIP data (country, city, coordinates). It generates a structured CSV report of flagged IPs, useful for security monitoring or SOC workflows.
